Objective: 

This repository contains two different datasets and their corresponding data analysis and machine learning implementations using Python.  
Each dataset addresses a separate real-world problem and uses appropriate analytical techniques.

Dataset 1: Sales Dataset (Time Series Analysis)

File Name:`Sales Dataset.csv`

Description
This dataset contains historical sales data recorded over time.  
It is used to analyze sales trends and forecast future sales using time series techniques.

Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing
- Line plot visualization
- ARIMA time series forecasting
- RMSE for model evaluation

Dataset 2: Heart Disease Dataset (Classification)

File Name:`heart.csv`

Description
This dataset contains medical information of patients and is used to predict whether a person has heart disease based on various health parameters.

Techniques Used
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Logistic Regression model
- Confusion matrix
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how different datasets require different analytical approaches:
- Time series forecasting for sales prediction
- Classification modeling for medical diagnosis

Both projects follow a step-by-step data science workflow from data loading to model evaluation.
